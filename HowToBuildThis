We need to use the package "devtools".
library("devtools")

Naviage to the directory of the package:
setwd("~/postdoc_stuff/HDAC_project/Scripts/r_package_files/pRRophetic2")
check() # to check everything
build() # to build...

Best way is just to do this:
The following will build and also compress the data, i.e. take about 100mb off the size of the tarball:
pgeeleher@genemed12:~/Dropbox/HDAC_project_Scripts/r_package_files$ R CMD build --resave-data pRRophetic
